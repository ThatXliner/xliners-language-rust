# xliners-language-rust

My attempt of a better [Rust][rust] grammar for [Atom][atom]

---

Fork of [atom-language-rust](https://github.com/miqh/atom-language-rust) with better scopes (based off of [those](https://github.com/MagicStack/MagicPython/blob/master/misc/scopes) from [MagicPython](https://github.com/MagicStack/MagicPython)). Also designed for my [Fall Syntax][fall-syntax] theme.

[atom]: https://atom.io/
[rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/
